# Internship Manager Tool

### Currently under development.

This is a commmand line tool to help manage internship applications. 

## To Use

1. Clone git repository
2. Now you need to compile and link the cpp files. Go to your terminal and type the following commands

        g++ -c main.cpp 
        g++ -c App.cpp
        g++ -o <name-of-executable-file>.exe main.o App.o

3. To run the tool you can now just type in the terminal:

        ./<name-of-executable-file>.exe


And now you can keep track of all your applications, and edit them from the terminal.


#### What is working?

At the time of me writing this 15/July/2020, the display, add and update applications features are working.
