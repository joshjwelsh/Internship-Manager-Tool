# Internship Manager Tool

### Currently under development.

This is a commmand line tool to help manage internship applications. 

## To Use

1. Clone git repository
2. Now you need to compile and link the cpp files. Go to your terminal and type the following commands

        g++ -c main.cpp 
        g++ -c App.cpp
        g++ -o <name-of-executable-file> main.o App.o

3. To run the tool you can now just type in the terminal:

        ./<name-of-executable-file>


And now you can keep track of all your applications, and edit them from the terminal.
